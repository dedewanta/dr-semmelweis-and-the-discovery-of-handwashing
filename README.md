# Datacamp Project: Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

**Author:** Denny Dewanta  
**Tools:** Python

## Project Description

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a groundbreaking discovery: he identified the importance of handwashing in healthcare. At the time, contaminated hands were a major contributing factor to the spread of childbed fever, resulting in numerous deaths. Dr. Semmelweis's implementation of handwashing protocols at his hospital led to a significant reduction in mortality rates, saving countless lives and highlighting the critical role of hygiene in medical practice.

This Datacamp project aims to analyze historical data related to Dr. Semmelweis's work and its impact on mortality rates. Through data analysis and visualization using Python, the project delves into the statistics that supported Dr. Semmelweis's findings and showcases the power of data-driven decision-making in the field of medicine.
